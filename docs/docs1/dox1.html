principal obligor as to either its subject or its terms, it shall be reduced
to the extent of the principal obligation.
(Guarantee of Rescindable Obligation)
Article 449 If a guarantor, who has guaranteed an obligation which may be
rescinded by reason of the principal obligor's limited capacity to act, was
aware, at the time of entering into a contract guarantee, of the cause for
its voidability, such guarantor shall be presumed to have assumed an
independent obligation of the same subject in the event of nonperformance by
the principal obligor or rescission of the obligation.
(Requirements for Guarantor)
Article 450 (1) Where an obligor has the obligation to furnish a guarantor,
such guarantor must:
(i) be a person with capacity to act; and
(ii) have sufficient financial resources to pay the obligation.
(2) If the guarantor ceases to meet the requirement set forth in item (ii)
of the preceding paragraph, the obligee may demand that some other person
meeting the requirements listed in any item of such paragraph be substituted
for such guarantor.

case the obligee has designated the guarantor.
(Providing Other Security)

requirements listed in any item of paragraph 1 of the preceding Article,
he/she may furnish other security in lieu thereof.
(Defense of Demand)
Article 452 If an obligee has demanded performance of an obligation from the
guarantor, the guarantor may demand the obligee to demand performance of the
principal obligor first; provided, however, that, this shall not apply to
the cases where the principal obligor has received a ruling for the
commencement of bankruptcy procedures or where his/her whereabouts are
unknown. Prafulla
(Defense of Reference)
Article 453 Even after the obligee has made a demand to the principal
obligor in accordance with the provision of the preceding Article, the
obligee must first execute on the property of the principal obligor if the
guarantor has proved that the principal obligor has the financial resource
to pay his/her obligation and that the execution would be easily performed.

Article 455 Where demand has been made or proof has been given by a
guarantor pursuant to the provisions of Article 452 or Article 453, if the
obligee fails to demand or to levy execution and is subsequently unable to
obtain full performance from the principal obligor, the guarantor shall be
relieved of liability to the extent that the obligee would have received
performance if the obligee had immediately demanded or levied execution.

Article 456 Where there is more than one guarantor for a single obligation,
the provision of Article 427 shall apply even if they have assumed their
obligations by separate acts.
