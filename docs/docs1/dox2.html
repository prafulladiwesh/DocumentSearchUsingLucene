  Article 462 (1) If a person, who has become a guarantor without the
entrustment of the principal obligor, has performed the obligation or has
otherwise in exchange for his/her own property procured the release from
liability of the principal obligor, the principal obligor must reimburse the
guarantor to the extent that the principal obligor was enriched at the time
of such performance of the obligation.
(2) A person who has become a guarantor against the will of the principal
obligor shall have the right to obtain reimbursement only to the extent that
the principal obligor is actually enriched. In such case, if the principal
obligor asserts that he/she had, prior to the day of the demand for
reimbursement, grounds for set-off against the obligee, the guarantor may
demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been
extinguished by operation of such set-off.
